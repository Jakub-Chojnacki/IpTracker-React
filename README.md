# IpTracker-React

https://iptrackerjc.netlify.app/

As the name suggests - it is an IP Tracking website.
You can input an IP Address to get ISP and Location data from ipify geolocation API. Location data is used to display a map with React Leaflet and to get current weather data from OpenWeather API.
## Technologies used:
* React (with Vite)
* Ipify geolocation API
* Leaflet (React Leaflet library)
* Framer Motion
* React Icons

🔴IMPORTANT❗🔴\
Some adblocking extension(like uBlock) might interfere and block the API response. 
Try turning it off and refreshing the website if you can't see the map.
